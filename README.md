```
REACT_APP_ID=your_spotify_client_id
REACT_APP_SECRET_KEY=your_spotify_client_secret
```
Then, once that file is created and named ".env", run the command 
### `npm start`
From there, the site should open under the URL localhost:3000. Click Search to generate a random song, or click See a Random Joke to navigate to the joke API page.
